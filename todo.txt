- Rails 3 support
- Add Valuable#to_yaml and Valuable.from_yaml
- make it easy to include validatable or ActiveRecord::Validations
- make it easy to use has_value from activerecord model.
- add optional :always_klass ?
- for :klass => :integer, 'abc' resolves to 0 ... fix that.
- optionally, values should be on the class rather than the instance, as in:
  Config < ValuableClass
    has_value :background_color
  end

  Config.background_color

- 2. Create a 'Valuable::Presenter' base class that filters out rails params, handles nested params, knows 0 is false for checkboxes, works with form_for#checkbox...

class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  
  def reviews
    @presenter = ReviewPresenter.new(params)

    @product = @presenter.product
    @reviews = @presenter.reviews 
    
  end
  
end

which currently raises:
undefined method `action=' for #<ReviewPresenter:0x5e7fa18>


like this:
  def initialize(atts = {})
    super(atts.except('action', 'controller'))
  end
